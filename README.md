# zmk-config
ZMK keyboard config for 5-column corne keyboard. Based loosely on miryoku layout but extended in order to optimise for a wide variety of tasks such as:

- Standard typing using the Colemak keyboard layout, with most used symbols and letters on the home row
- Niri window manager navigation, with some limited compatability with windows (e.g. uses Alt + F4 for close window and Alt + Tab for switching windows)
- Coding & Neovim navigation (e.g. commonly used symbols arranged to be intuitive, such as ^ to go to the left and $ to go to the right). 
- Excel navigation (e.g. F2 & F4 easily accessible, ctrl & shift with arrows easy to access)
- PDF & Word document editting and viewing (e.g. macro above arrow keys will rapidly press arrow keys 4 times, which is sometimes easier for moving shapes)
- Video & Volume control with various media shortcuts on the media layer (e.g. volume controls, fast forward, skips, etc.) (Note: certain video controls may need config on your system in order to work)

It is easy to modify as it was made using Nick Coutsos' online visual editor
